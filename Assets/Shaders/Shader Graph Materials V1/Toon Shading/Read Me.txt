Toon Shader uses the main light to create toon shading like cartoon.

### Surface Inputs
- Texture Color: The base color texture of the material.
- Light Intensity: Changes how bright the surface is.
- Shadow Edge: Defines where the shadow starts.
- Shadow Tint: Defines the tint/darkness to apply.
- Shadow Smoothness: Defines how smooth the transition between edges.

Try to keep the second edge below the first one to have a correct look
